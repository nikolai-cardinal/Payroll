1. Always before writing a new code make sure there are no existing code available that doing the simulair option.
2. Make sure your code is minimal and don't contains extra unnessary script. 
3. Always double check the script before providing it to me.   
4. Don't ever create a new files only inless receive explisit direction to do so. 
5. If you ever create the new file allways update @FILE_STRUCTURE file to be updated version. 
6. When adding triggers (e.g. `onOpen`, `onEdit`) or building menus, first search the codebase for existing definitions and extend them or expose helper functions instead of introducing duplicate trigger functions to prevent menu collisions. 
7. The sheet previously named 'Hourly + Spiff Pay' has been renamed to 'Main'. Always reference the sheet as 'Main' and update any existing occurrences of the old name when modifying or adding code. 
8. Make sure that Main and any file do not Exceed 500 lines of code. 
9. `Main` must contain only trigger functions and high-level delegation; no business logic. 500-line hard limit.
10. Each functional module must expose a single public entry file named `index` that `Main` calls.
11. All sheet names and global constants live in `src/core/Constants`. `Main` should import/reference them instead of hardcoding.
12. Any backward-compatibility wrapper functions belong in `src/core/Proxies`, never in `Main`. 
13. Always edit function documentation file. 
14. `src/core/Constants` must export immutable objects `SHEET` (sheet names) and `MENU` (UI labels) and attach them to `Modules.Constants` for global access.
