/**
 * 1. OVERVIEW
 * ------------
 * The Lead Set feature automates the calculation and distribution of lead-based commissions
 * for technicians. It processes job revenue data from the Lead Set sheet and applies a tiered
 * commission structure based on total revenue amounts.
 * 
 * Key capabilities:
 * - Automated calculation of lead commissions using tiered percentages
 * - Smart data handling to avoid duplicate entries
 * - Batch processing for all technicians
 * - Integration with the existing payroll workflow
 * - Detailed reporting in technician sheets
 * 
 * The feature is integrated into the Technician Tools menu under Payroll and 
 * follows the existing Payroll sequence.
 */

 *     - Update All Rates
 *     - All Spiff/Bonus
 *     - All PBP

/**
 * 4. ERROR CODE REFERENCE
 * ----------------------
 * 4.1 Common Error Messages
 *     - "Lead Set sheet not found" - The Lead Set sheet is missing or renamed
 *     - "Revenue must be a valid number" - Invalid revenue data in Lead Set sheet
 *     - "No technicians found in Hourly + Spiff Pay sheet" - Missing technician data
 *     - "Could not find 'Customer Name' header in column E" - Invalid sheet structure
 * 
 * 4.2 Troubleshooting Steps
 *     1. Verify Lead Set sheet exists and contains proper data
 *     2. Check that technician names match exactly between sheets
 *     3. Ensure revenue values are valid numbers
 *     4. Verify sheet structure has expected headers and sections
 *     5. Review execution logs for detailed error information
 */

/**
 * 5. MAINTENANCE NOTES
 * -------------------
 * 5.1 Code Structure
 *     - Functions are organized to be small and focused (25-30 lines maximum)
 *     - Batch operations are used to minimize API calls to the spreadsheet
 *     - Error handling is implemented throughout with detailed logging
 *     - All functions are documented with JSDoc comments
 *     - Use descriptive variable names for better readability
 * 
 * 5.2 Modification Guidelines
 *     - When changing commission tiers, update determineCommissionPercentage() function
 *     - If sheet structure changes, update column indices in getLeadDataForTechnician()
 *     - For new formatting requirements, modify formatLeadSetCells() function
 *     - When adding new error handling, follow existing pattern with proper logging
 * 
 * 5.3 Performance Considerations
 *     - Batch operations are used wherever possible to minimize API calls
 *     - Caching is implemented for repeated lookups
 *     - Row identification is optimized to avoid unnecessary searches
 *     - For large datasets, consider implementing pagination or chunking
 */

/**
 * 6. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
 * -------------------------
 * The system uses a robust approach for deleting old data and adding new data:
 * 
 * 6.1 Intelligent Section Detection
 *     - Locates the "Install Customer Data" section using findInstallCustomerDataSection()
 *     - Identifies section boundaries by finding the next section header with findNextSectionAfterInstall()
 *     - Ensures changes are made only within the correct spreadsheet section
 * 
 * 6.2 Selective Data Clearing
 *     - Uses clearLeadDataInInstallSection() to only clear rows marked with "L-E-A-D" in column J
 *     - Only clears columns E-J (5-10), preserving columns A-D
 *     - Ensures data from other features remains untouched
 * 
 * 6.3 Smart Data Writing
 *     - smartWriteLeadDataToSheet() reuses existing rows when possible
 *     - Updates existing rows first before looking for empty rows
 *     - Clears excess rows if fewer new entries than existing rows
 *     - Uses batch operations to minimize API calls
 *     - Maintains proper formatting for dates and currency values
 * 
 * 6.4 Data Handling Requirements
 *     - Only updates specific cells, not entire rows
 *     - Replaces existing entries rather than adding new rows
 *     - Maintains proper formatting for currency and dates
 *     - Handles errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
 * 
 * 6.5 Robust Error Handling
 *     - Includes validation checks before operations
 *     - Logs detailed error information
 *     - Handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., when no leads found)
 *     - Preserves data integrity with transaction-like approach
