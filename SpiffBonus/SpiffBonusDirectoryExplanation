*   **`SpiffBonusCalculator`**
    *   **Purpose:** Calculates the total Spiff/Bonus amount based on specific rules defined within the function. *Note: In the last reviewed version, this specific calculation logic wasn't directly used by the main processor, which instead summed amounts from filtered data, but the function is preserved here.*

*   **`SpiffBonusSummaryUpdater`**
